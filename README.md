High school projects that I found on my old hard drive
## APCSP (Awesome Polygons Create Serious Pwnage)
Bullet hell game made in Java for my AP Computer Science A portfolio.  
Difficulty increases the longer you survive. Also, run speed decreases because I stored all the bullets and shapes in arraylists and iterated over them to detect collisions, which is the most stupid and inefficient thing ever in hindsight.  
Arrow keys or WASD to move, Space or Z to shoot, Shift or X to slow, CTRL or C to bomb.
## Platformer Game
Platformer game I made with [Alvin](https://github.com/realalvinnerds) for our AP Computer Science A final project.  
Difficulty increases the longer you survive, and game gets slower just like APCSP game. Also there's actually a plot now! But good luck surviving long enough to read it! :D  
Arrow keys to move and jump, space to shoot. Collect coins to unleash power ups.
## Cellular Automata
Program simulating [elementary cellular automata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elementary_cellular_automaton) I made for fun after learning about them in AP Calc BC.  
Type in "rule [number]" and the program will create and display the model generated using that rule.  
The model gets really glitchy at the edges since it can't check the cell to its upper left or upper right.
## Mandelbrot
Program simulating the [mandelbrot set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandelbrot_set) I made for fun after learning about it in AP Calc BC.  After executing, the program will run through the grid and calculate the mandelbrot function f(z) = z^2 + c on that set of coordinates, and display the divergent/convergent pixels with either black or white.
